The application will report back an informative pie chart of the users monthly expenses as well as a savings goal with a progress bar.

She needs help in gathering and organizing the business data she requires to profitably manage her business. Specifically the owner needs to determine the necessary number of pizza delivery drivers she must staff at each location during the hours the pizza branches are open. The pizza store owner requests a separate table for each location. Each table should include: each hour of the day, the number of pizzas sold, the number of deliveries made, and the number of delivery drivers recommended. The pizza owner would also like a form to input marketing variables so that the production needs of a new location can be calculated.</p>"
