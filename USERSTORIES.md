User Stories

As a ROLE, I WANT  , SO THAT (Benefit)

## As the CLIENT/USER (Potential Employer)::
1. I desire an attractive user friendly portfolio tool


 that not only gathers marketing information but effectively markets our brand to potential customers.
2. I desire an app to display potential products to bus riders and receives feedback as to which are the most popular choices for purchase.
3. I desire the app to return not only the number of times a particular item is selected, but also the percentage of the time it is selected when shown.
4. I desire that the click percentages data be visually represented.

## As the DEVELOPER (Potential Employee):

1. I will develop an attractive functioning market research app.
2. I will develop the app to their technical specifications:
  * three random photos will be placed on an image page side by side.
  * the user will select the image of the product they would most likely buy.
  * three new images will be displayed after each selection.
  * after 25 selections the user will be provided two buttons to either select to receive the results or make 10 more selections.
  * for each item displayed this data will be gathered:
      * the total number of times an image was displayed.
      * the total number of clicks received.
      * the percentage of times an item was clicked when it was shown.
  * the data gathered for each image will be displayed in a colorful bar chart using ChartJs and placed below the area of the three images.
  * the results will be given ongoing persistence through a page refresh or a browser closing, by being preserved in local storage.
