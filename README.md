Your professional online presence

The portfolio site that you create will highlight your projects and your interests, and showcase your skills to potential employers or clients.

You will create, from scratch, a static portfolio site (no "backend server" code required), to represent your personal online presence.

PART 1

User Stories: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Let these user stories guide your development:

As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.

As the creator, I want the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.

As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.


User Stories: Stretch Goals

As a visitor, I want the site to look reasonable, so that I can read it on any device.

As a visitor, I want the portfolio to show the newest projects on top so that I can easily see the developers recent work.

As a visitor, I want relative timestamps on projects to give me a idea of how many days ago something was created.


Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

Use good Object Oriented code: Create a constructor function for projects.
Leave as little in the window (global) namespace as possible: attach functions to objects, etc.

Use jQuery to clone the example markup for each project, as you add additional content.

Your Project prototype should have a .toHtml() function that adds new data to the DOM.

To make it look better, include basic styles: a css reset, content in a single centered column, reasonable margins, etc.
